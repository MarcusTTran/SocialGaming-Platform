# Team Contract

The purpose of this team contract is to give your team a point of reference
for the goals, expectations, and processes over the semester. It can help to
avoid conflicts later on. You can also refine them as a team if you need to
later on.

## Goals

What are the collective goals you have as a group for the project? Your
individual and collective goals need not be the same. You only need alignment
on group goals.

---
1. Meet all the iteration deadlines with a reasonably improved product every time that functions
1. Create industry-quality code with good use of both compositional and inheritance programming 
1. The project will be thoroughly tested and documented by the end of our deadline.
1. Code reusability and modularity
1. Efficient functioning as a collective group on the project 
1. Efficient, respectful collaboration 
1. For the entire group to have the same level of understanding of each component in our project

## Expectations / Responsibilities

Consider:

* What do you expect of each other as a group?
* How often and when do you plan to meet?
* How do you plan to communicate with each other in meetings and outside of
  them?
* What are your expectations for response time / latency?
* How do you want to manage contributions?
  How should they be reviewed?
  How can you ensure that contributions are agreed on, compatible, and merged
  on time?
* How do you want to make design decisions as a group?

1. Team members will check Discord and other messaging platforms at least once every 2 days. Discord is our primary collaboration platform.
1. If a team member will not be available, they should warn the group in advance
1. Team members will ideally contribute *more* than the minimum lines of code per week (which can also be through documentation and other managerial tasks)
1. Each member will be treated with respect. Everyone’s ideas will be heard and discussed, and, if needed be, turned down politely.
1. Merges into the main branch will be reviewed by at least 2 other team members through a pull request. (Request rule change from Prof)
1. All branches must be merged at least once a week to maintain consistency and prevent conflicts.
1. If members decide to pair-program, lines committed should be split evenly unless explicitly agreed otherwise by all members in that session. 
1. General meetings will occur once a week on Thursday from 5 p.m. - 7 p.m. This can also be a time for collaboration if there is nothing to meet about. If a member cannot make it, they will catch up with another team member who did attend within 2 days.
1. Tuesdays will be for collaboration and pair programming.
1. Emergency meetings may occur in the event of an important conflict…
1. No one person has the utmost authority on the design of the project. Everyone’s voices are treated equally.
1. When in doubt, over-comment rather than under-comment. If there is an issue with commenting, we can comment on that in the pull request or on Discord.
1. Use git merge main --ff (fast-forward) 
1. Never delete a branch or squash commits. 
1. When in doubt, ask Discord for help (there is a help channel)

## Conflict or missed expectation resolution

Suppose you have a disagreement or conflict. How do you want to manage it?

---
1. If a member does not respond within 2 days, they will be privately messaged or pinged in our Discord for signs of life. If this persists for a week or more, they will be reported to the teaching staff. 
1. If there is a disagreement in design that cannot be resolved privately, it will be brought up in Discord or during a meeting for discussion and vote. Also, if there is uncertainty, create a discussion post in Coursys.
1. In the event of a personal dispute or altercation, there will be a meeting to resolve it. If it cannot be resolved civilly, teaching staff will be involved. 
1. Should a team member decide to delete or re-make large portions of someone else’s code without consent from the group, they will be questioned as soon as possible.
1. If a team member is accused of falsifying work or committing similar acts of fraud, it will be investigated by at least 3 group members to uncover the truth.
